# Unix-Pentesting Project

Shell scripting is a powerful method for automating tasks and managing systems in Unix-based operating systems. By writing scripts composed of a series of shell commands, users can streamline complex processes, from system administration to application deployment and beyond. Shell scripts enable the automation of repetitive tasks, such as file manipulation, program execution, and system monitoring, reducing the potential for human error and saving time.
